# learning-map-app

This is the first version of the LEARNING-MAP APP Version 1.0, developed in July 2017. Its a free App developed by Team Mofaasa, who are members in the Andela Uganda's second bootcamp cohort.

The App helps boot-campers track their learning progress.LEARNING-MAP allows the user to login by simply entering their username. The user can then add all the bootcamp desired skills and also indicate the learnt skills, then the unstudied skills will be generated together with a progress report,however LEARNING-MAP has been built to function for a single session so your data will not be stored after you close your session, we hope to include permanent storage in the future versions. 

To use LEARNING-MAP,all you need is a computer in a good working condition.
